name: Compile genconfig binary

# This GitHub action compiles the genconfig binary that cm-donyc3021etc then uses when
# updating the global config. Controlling this here gives more control and visibility
# into that process, as things like changes in Go versions can break the build (since genconfig relies on flashlight),
# which is brittle and hard to track down.
