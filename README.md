# Lantern [![Go Actions Status](https://github.com/getlantern/flashlight/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/getlantern/flashlight/actions) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/getlantern/flashlight/badge.svg?t=C4SaZX)](https://coveralls.io/github/getlantern/flashlight)

## Maintainers
@oxtoacart, @hwh33, @myleshorton

This repo contains the core Lantern library as well as the Android and iOS bindings.

The Lantern desktop application can be found at [getlantern/lantern-desktop](lantern-desktop).

## Process for making changes to [config](config)
flashlight is configured with per-proxy configuration loaded from the config-server, and global configuration loaded from S3 at runtime.

The global configuration is generated by [genconfig](genconfig) running as a [CRON job](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern-infrastructure/tree/main/salt/update_masquerades) on cm-donyc3021etc. That job uses the latest version of `genconfig` that is pushed to releases in this repo via CI.

genconfig merges [embeddedconfig/global.yaml.tmpl](embeddedconfig/global.yaml.tmpl) with dynamically verified masquerade hosts to produce the final global config. [embeddedconfig/download_global.sh](embeddedconfig/download_global.sh) pulls in that change and runs anytime we run `go generate`. A [CI Job](https://github.com/getlantern/flashlight/blob/main/.github/workflows/globalconfig.yml) runs `go generate` and automatically commits the results to this repo.

**All clients, including old versions of flashlight, fetch the same global config from S3, so global.yaml.tmpl must remain backwards compatible with old clients.**

If you're simply changing the contents of `global.yaml.tmpl` without any structural changes to the Go files in `config`, you can just change `global.yaml.tmpl` directly and once it's committed to main, it will fairly soon be reflected in S3.

If you're making changes to structure of the configuration, you need to ensure that this stays backwards compatible with old clients. To this end, we keep copies of old versions of [config](config), for example [config_v1](config_v1). When making a structural change to the config, follow these steps:

1. Back up the current version of `config`, for example `cp -R config config_v2`
2. Update the code and tests in `config` as appropriate
3. Make sure the tests in `config_v2`, `config_v1` etc. still work

## Adding new domain fronting mappings

In addition to adding the domains that forward on Cloudfront and Akamai, you also have to add the appropriate lines to [this](https://github.com/getlantern/flashlight/blob/main/genconfig/provider_map.yaml).

Mappings on Cloudfront and Akamai can be added using the terraform config in `lantern-cloud`.

## Building
In CI, `flashlight` used `GH_TOKEN` for access to private repositories.

You can build an SDK for use by external applications either for Android or for iOS.

### Prerequisites

* [Go 1.19](https://golang.org/dl/) is the minimum supported version of Go
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) if you want to use the Makefile
* Dependencies are managed with Go Modules.
* Force git to use ssh instead of https by running
  `git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"`

## A note on iOS and memory usage
The iOS application needs to run as a background process on iOS, meaning that it's severely memory restricted. Because of this, we disable a lot of protocols and extra features using `// go:build !ios` in order to conserve memory.

### Why not use // +build !ios
go-mobile automatically sets the `ios` build tag when building for iOS. In our case, we don't use this because in addition to the iOS app, we also distribute an iOS SDK that's intended for embedding inside of user-interactice apps. This SDK does not have to run in the background and is thus not memory constrained in the same way as our iOS app. Consequently, the sdk can and does include all of the standard lantern protocols and features.

### Architecture

## Features

We use "features" to enable/disable different characteristics/techniques in Flashlight, usually through the global config.

See `./config/features.go` for a list of features. Below is a non-extensive description of each feature.

### p2pcensoredpeer and p2pfreepeer

Allows the client to act either as a FreePeer or a CensoredPeer.

See overview of the p2p-proxying story here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUjZHgpnunmwG3wUwlSmCKFwOGOXkkwyGd7cgrOJzbs/edit

## A Note on Versioning
Until recently, flashlight and the applications that use it used only a single versions number, whatever the application itself was built with. This version number was used for various things:

- Displaying a version number in the UI
- Checking which application features are enabled based on the global configuration
- Telling our server infrastructure (especially config-server) what version of Lantern we're running so that it can assign appropriate proxies based on what that version supports
- Checking whether there's an update available via autoupdate

Because the various applications that use flashlight are in their own repos and built independently of each other, this created a coordination problem. Specifically, since pluggable transport support depends on the code level of flashlight, not of the application itself, we had to either synchronize the version numbering between the different apps, or configure the server-side infrastructure to recognize that depending on the application, different version numbers might actually mean the same flashlight code level.

To rectify this, flashlight now uses two different version numbers.

Application Version - this is like the original Version that's baked in at application build time. It is still used for displaying the version in the UI, checking enabled features, and auto-updates.

Library Version - this is hardcoded into the flashlight source code and is submitted to our servers via the X-Lantern-Version header for purposes of assigning proxies.

### When and how to update Library Version
Whenever the capabilities of flashlight have changed in a way that matters to our server-side infrastructure (e.g. a pluggable transport was added or modified), we increment the `LibraryVersion` in `version.go`.

### Why not use Go module versioning?
Our infrastructure already expects version numbers in the 7.x range, so switching to Go module versioning would require making a /v7 version of the flashlight module.

Flashlight and the applications that use it use two related but separate version numbers.
